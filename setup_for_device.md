3. **Beautiful design** - Professional gradient background with clear buttons
4. **Flexible** - Easy to customize colors, add more buttons, etc.

### 🔄 Development Cycle

### 📱 Widget Features

- **Medium and Small sizes supported**
- **4 action buttons** with clear icons and labels
- **Beautiful gradient background**
- **Instant app launch** with specific actions
- **URL scheme communication** between widget and app

### 🎨 Customization Ideas

Want to modify the widget? Edit `ios/ProcreateHelperWidget/ProcreateHelperWidget.swift`:

- **Change colors**: Modify `.background(Color.blue)` etc.
- **Add more buttons**: Copy existing Link blocks
- **Change layout**: Modify VStack/HStack arrangements
- **Add new actions**: Add URL schemes like `procreatehelper://newaction`

The Flutter app will automatically handle new URL schemes if you add them to the `_handleIncomingUrl` method in `lib/main.dart`.
